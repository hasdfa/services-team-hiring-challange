# MUI Assistant: Engineering Challenges

Welcome to the MUI Assistant hiring challenge! This project is a simplified version of our production chat application, designed to assess your full-stack engineering skills.

## Overview

You'll choose **ONE** of the four challenges below to complete in **4-6 hours**. Each challenge tests different aspects of software engineering that are critical to our team.

## Challenge Options

| Challenge                                                                  | Focus Area       | Complexity  | Skills Tested                                |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------- | ----------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| **[Challenge 1: Build Queue System](./challenge-1-build-queue.md)**        | Backend/Systems  | Medium-High | Concurrency, queue design, database patterns |
| **[Challenge 2: Auto-Fix Model Integration](./challenge-2-auto-fix.md)**   | Full-Stack/AI    | High        | AI integration, streaming, full-stack        |
| **[Challenge 3: Code Quality Scoring](./challenge-3-code-scoring.md)**     | Backend/Analysis | Medium      | Tool integration, metrics, API design        |
| **[Challenge 4: Frontend Streaming](./challenge-4-frontend-streaming.md)** | Frontend/State   | Medium      | Real-time UI, SWR patterns, TypeScript       |

## How to Choose

### Choose Challenge 1 or 3 if you:

- Prefer backend/systems engineering
- Enjoy architectural design problems
- Like working with queues, databases, or analysis tools

### Choose Challenge 2 if you:

- Want to showcase full-stack capabilities
- Are interested in AI/LLM integration
- Enjoy working across the entire stack

### Choose Challenge 4 if you:

- Prefer frontend engineering
- Excel at state management and real-time UIs
- Want to demonstrate React/TypeScript expertise

## General Guidelines

### Time Management

- **4-6 hours recommended**
- **8 hours hard limit**
- Track your time in `SOLUTION.md`

### What We're Looking For

1. **Engineering Judgment**: Choose the right tools and patterns
2. **Code Quality**: Clean, maintainable, well-structured code
3. **Communication**: Clear documentation and explanations
4. **Trade-offs**: Acknowledge limitations and future improvements

### What You Should NOT Do

- Don't over-engineer (YAGNI principle)
- Don't skip error handling
- Don't forget documentation
- Don't ignore edge cases

### Submission Requirements

1. **Working Code**: All code committed to your repo
2. **SOLUTION.md**: Detailed explanation (use `SOLUTION_TEMPLATE.md`)
3. **Time Log**: Approximate hours spent
4. **Running Instructions**: How to test your implementation

### Questions?

If you have clarifying questions:

- Check `README.md` for setup instructions
- Review existing code patterns
- Make reasonable assumptions and document them

Good luck! We're excited to see your approach to these problems. Remember: there's no single "right" answer. We're evaluating your problem-solving process, not just the end result.

## Next Steps

1. Read the challenge that interests you
2. Review the existing codebase
3. Copy `SOLUTION_TEMPLATE.md` to `SOLUTION.md`
4. Start coding!
